RePlate - Food Waste Reduction Platform

## Inspiration 

Today, our team was brainstorming ideas for our project when we noticed something that sparked our inspiration. During lunch, we noticed a significant amount of surplus food left over, and later, we heard that even more food was left over after the second round. We didn‚Äôt know whether the food was reused or just thrown away, which made us think deeply about how much food actually goes to waste.
At our university, Texas State, we‚Äôve also seen dining hall staff dispose of fresh, untouched food at midnight. Watching good food being thrown away while knowing that so many people struggle to get a single meal was eye-opening. That moment motivated us to think of a way to connect surplus food with people who truly need it.

We researched the issue further and discovered that food waste is a massive global problem, while hunger remains a critical challenge for millions. Seeing those statistics made us realize that even a small initiative could make a big difference. That‚Äôs when we decided to build our project around reducing food waste and helping redistribute surplus food to the needy.

## üéØ The Problem

- Restaurants waste **25-40%** of food purchased daily
- Food waste generates **8-10%** of global greenhouse gas emissions  
- Shelters struggle to source fresh, nutritious meals
- Traditional donation systems take **days** and involve complex coordination

## üí° Our Solution

RePlate is a lightweight web platform that **instantly** connects restaurants with surplus food to local shelters and food banks through:


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (responsive)
- **Maps:** Google Maps API
- **Version Control:** GitHub API integration

RePlate is a real-time web platform that connects restaurants with surplus food to local shelters and food banks. The application facilitates instant food donation matching through SMS notifications, location-based pairing, and gamification mechanics. Built as a hackathon-ready demonstration project, it showcases social impact through quantified metrics like carbon footprint reduction and meals saved.

Core Purpose: Reduce restaurant food waste (25-40% daily average) by creating frictionless donation workflows that complete in under 60 seconds.

Application Pattern
Single-Page Application (SPA) with RESTful API backend. The frontend uses vanilla JavaScript with client-side routing, while the backend serves as a stateless API layer.

Rationale: Simplicity and hackathon speed. Avoids framework complexity while maintaining professional UX through progressive enhancement.
