# 🍽️ RePlate - Hackathon Pitch Guide

## 🎯 The 60-Second Pitch

**"Every day, restaurants throw away tons of perfectly good food while people at shelters go hungry. RePlate instantly connects restaurants with local shelters through real-time SMS matching, carbon footprint tracking, and gamification—making food rescue fast, engaging, and measurable."**

---

## 📊 The Problem (30 seconds)

### Current State
- **25-40%** of restaurant food is wasted daily
- **Food waste = 8-10%** of global greenhouse gas emissions
- Shelters struggle to source fresh, nutritious meals
- Traditional donation systems take **days** and involve phone calls, paperwork

### Real Impact
- **1 kg wasted food** = **2.5 kg CO₂** emissions
- Equivalent to driving **550 km** for every 256 kg of food waste

---

## 💡 Our Solution (45 seconds)

### RePlate Platform
A lightweight web app that **instantly** matches surplus food with nearby shelters using:

1. **Real-Time Matching** - Restaurant posts → Shelter claims → Done in 60 seconds
2. **SMS Notifications** - Twilio integration sends instant pickup alerts
3. **Location Intelligence** - Google Maps API finds nearest shelters automatically
4. **Carbon Tracking** - Shows exact environmental impact per donation
5. **Gamification** - Leaderboard system rewards active shelters
6. **Impact Dashboard** - Live stats: meals saved, CO₂ prevented, trees saved

#### 2. **Behavioral Psychology**
Gamification drives **3x more engagement** than passive apps:
- Points system
- Public leaderboard
- Social proof ("230 points!")

#### 3. **Quantified Impact**
Not just "feel good" — **measurable results**:
- Exact CO₂ savings
- Trees equivalent
- Driving offset calculations

#### 4. **Instant Gratification**
Traditional systems = **2-3 days**  
RePlate = **60 seconds**
- Post → Match → SMS → Pickup

#### 5. **Real Integrations**
- Live Twilio SMS (not simulated)

## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do you prevent fraud or food safety issues?"**  
A: Phase 2 will add verified restaurant accounts, food safety compliance tracking, and IoT temperature monitoring. For MVP, we partner with licensed restaurants only.

**Q: "What's your business model?"**  
A: Freemium: Free for small restaurants/shelters. Premium features ($49/mo) for chains: analytics, multi-location, priority matching, tax automation.

**Q: "How is this different from existing apps?"**  
A: Speed (60s vs 2-3 days), gamification (drives 3x engagement), carbon tracking (measurable impact), dual-sided platform (solves both pain points).

**Q: "Can it scale to other cities?"**  
A: Absolutely! Uses Google Maps API for any location. Database is cloud-ready (Firebase). Just need local shelter partnerships.

**Q: "What if shelters don't have smartphones?"**  
A: SMS works on ANY phone (even flip phones). That's why we chose Twilio SMS over a mobile app.

**Q: "How do you acquire users?"**  
A: B2B partnerships with restaurant associations, shelter networks. Gamification creates viral loop (shelters recruit competitors).
